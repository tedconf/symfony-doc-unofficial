What's next?
============

If you have followed the instructions from the previous chapters, you should
now have a fully-functional symfony project, and are ready to experiment with
symfony.

You can start reading more documentation on the main
[documentation page](http://www.symfony-project.org/doc/1_3/) of your version.

On the documentation page, you will find the
[Jobeet](http://www.symfony-project.org/jobeet/1_3/Doctrine/en/) tutorial,
which is probably the best way to learn symfony. It explains in great detail
the development of a web application from start to finish, and also teaches
you the best practices of a web development. You can also buy it as a printed
[book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/2918390062?ie=UTF8&tag=symfonyprojec-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=2918390062).

You can also browse the symfony
[reference](http://www.symfony-project.org/reference/1_3/en/) guide and dive
into the symfony framework configuration. This book is an invaluable resource
when you need to find something quickly. As any other piece of symfony
documentation, it is also available as a printed
[book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/2918390054?ie=UTF8&tag=symfonyprojec-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=2918390054).

The symfony framework has a lot of great features and a lot of free
documentation. That said, one of the most valuable assets an Open-Source
project can have is its community, and symfony has one of the most active and
friendly communities around. If you start using symfony for your projects,
consider joining the symfony community:
