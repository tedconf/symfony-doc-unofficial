Introduction
============

The symfony framework is a full-stack MVC framework that helps you develop
websites faster. It also establishes a set of best practices that will help
you develop maintainable and secure websites. And advocating best practices
starts as soon as you want to install the framework itself.

Installing symfony is not that much different from installing any other PHP
software but to make your installation secure from the start, you cannot just
put all the files under your web root directory as described in many
installation guide. It will take slightly more time to install symfony, but
the effort is really worth it. Also, as for any other PHP software
installation, there are a lot of small traps that you can fall into that can
make your experience harder that it needs to be.

This tutorial teaches you everything you need to get started with a new
symfony project. From the installation of symfony itself to the creation of an
application and the web server configuration; at the end of the tutorial, you
will have a fully working symfony application, ready to be used for your next
project.
