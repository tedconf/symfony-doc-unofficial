What's next?
============

If you have followed the instructions from the previous chapters, you should
now have a fully-functional symfony project, and are ready to experiment with
symfony.

You can start reading more documentation on the main
[documentation page](http://www.symfony-project.org/doc/1_2/) of your version.

On this page, you will find the Jobeet tutorial, which is probably the best
way to learn symfony. It explains in great detail the development of a web
application from start to finish, and also teaches you the best practices of a
web development. You can also buy it as a printed book.

The symfony framework has a lot of great features and a lot of free
documentation. That said, one of the most valuable assets an Open-Source
project can have is its community, and symfony has one of the most active and
friendly communities around. If you start using symfony for your projects,
consider joining the symfony community:

  * Subscribe to the [user mailing-list](http://groups.google.com/group/symfony-users)

  * Subscribe to the official [blog feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/symfony/blog)

  * Come and chat on the [#symfony IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/symfony)
    channel on freenode
