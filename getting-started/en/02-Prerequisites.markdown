Prerequisites
=============

Before installing symfony, you need to check that your computer has everything
installed and configured correctly. Take the time to conscientiously read this
chapter and follow all the steps required to check your configuration as it
may save your day further down the road.

Software
--------

First of all, you need to check that your computer has a friendly working
environment for web development. At a minimum, you need a web server (Apache
for instance), a database engine (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or any
PDO-compatible database engine), and PHP 5.2.4 or later.

Command Line Interface
----------------------

The symfony framework comes bundled with a command line tool that automates a
lot of work for you. If you are a Unix-like OS users, you will feel right at
home. If you run a Windows system, it will also work fine, you will just have
to type a few commands in the `cmd` prompt.

>**Note**
>Unix shell commands can come in handy in a Windows environment.
>If you would like to use tools like `tar`, `gzip`, or `grep` on Windows you
>can install [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/).  The official docs are a little
>sparse, so a good installation guide can be found
>[here](http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~you/notes/cygwin-install.html).
>The adventurous may also like to try Microsoft's

PHP Configuration
-----------------

As PHP configurations can vary a lot from one OS to another, or even between
different Linux distributions, you need to check that your PHP configuration
meets the symfony minimum requirements.

First, ensure that you have PHP 5.2.4 at a minimum installed by using the
`phpinfo()` built-in function or by running `php -v` on the command line. Be
aware that on some configurations, you might have two different PHP versions
installed: one for the command line, and another for the web.

Then, download the symfony configuration checker script at the following URL:

    http://sf-to.org/1.2/check.php

Save the script somewhere under your current web root directory.

Launch the configuration checker script from the command line:

    $ php check_configuration.php

If there is a problem with your PHP current configuration, the output of the
command will give you hints on what to fix and how to fix it.

You should also execute the checker from a browser and fix the issues it might
discover. That's because PHP can have a distinct `php.ini` configuration file
for these two environments, with different settings.

>**NOTE**
>Don't forget to remove the file from your web root directory
>afterwards.
