About the Authors

Fabien Potencier
----------------

Fabien Potencier discovered the Web in 1994, at a time when connecting to the
Internet was still associated with the harmful strident sounds of a modem.
Being a developer by passion, he immediately started to build websites with
Perl. But with the release of PHP 5, he decided to switch focus to PHP, and
created the [symfony](http://www.symfony-project.org/) framework project in
2004 to help his company leverage the power of PHP for its customers.

Fabien is a serial-entrepreneur, and among other companies, he created
[Sensio](http://www.sensio.com/), a services and consulting company
specialized in web technologies and Internet marketing, in 1998.

Fabien is also the creator of several other Open-Source projects, a writer, a
blogger, a speaker at international conferences, and a happy father of two
wonderful kids.
