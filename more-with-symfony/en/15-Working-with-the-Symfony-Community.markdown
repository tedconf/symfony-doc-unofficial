Working with the symfony Community
==================================

*by Stefan Koopmanschap*

There are many reasons to work with Open-Source software. Being able to see
the source code is one. The software is often free. But one of the most
important reasons to choose Open-Source is the community. There's all kinds of
communities around Open-Source projects depending on the project. The symfony
community is generally described as being open and friendly. But
how can you get the most from your relationship with the community? And what
are the best ways to contribute something back? In this
chapter I want to introduce you to the symfony community and the ways to work
with it. Both individual people and companies will be able to get
some inspiration for the best way to interact with the community and
get the most out of it.

Getting the best from the Community
-----------------------------------

There's many ways to get something out of the symfony community. Some ways are
so integrated into the usage of symfony as a framework that you might not even
consider that it is actually only due to the community that you can do that. The
main thing, of course, is using symfony itself. Even though symfony was
initially developed by a company and still has a strong backing by Sensio, the
framework would never be where it is today without a strong community backing
it as well. So let's see how you gain from the community, besides the
framework itself.

### Support

Every developer, especially developers just starting out with the framework,
will get to a point where they have no idea how to proceed. You're stuck at a
point where you're just puzzled on the best way forward. Luckily, symfony has
a very friendly community that will help you out with just about any question
you might have. There are various ways to get your answers, depending on your
preference. The basic concept is usually the same though: You ask a question
and most of the time, you get a speedy answer.

#### Before asking a Question

Before you ask a question using one of the below methods, it is best to
first look for the solution yourself. You can of course use
[Google](http://www.google.com/) to search the wider web (and you should!) but
if you want to search a bit more specific, the archives of the different
mailinglists, especially the
[symfony-users archives](http://groups.google.com/group/symfony-users/topics),
are a good place to start.

#### Asking a Question

It is important to know how to ask a question. It may sound simple but it is
actually important to first think about what you're asking. Also, make sure
you have checked the existing documentation to see if your question has already
been answered. There are some general considerations that will
help you get a better response:

 * Think about your question. Make sure you formulate your question clearly.
   State what you are doing (or trying to do), what you are unable to do, and
   make sure to clearly mention any errors that you are getting.

 * Offer a short history of things you've tried. Reference the documentation
   you used to try to solve the problem, the possible solutions you found while
   searching the web or the mailinglist archives, or any of the things you
   tried while trying to solve the problem

#### Mailinglists

There are several [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com) around symfony for
different purposes. These mailinglists are the premier way of getting in touch
with users and developers of symfony. If you are working with symfony and
looking for support on a problem you have, then the
[symfony users](http://groups.google.com/group/symfony-users) is the place to be. The
subscribers to this mailinglist are a mixture of regular symfony users, symfony
beginners and most of the symfony core team. For any given question there
is usually someone that is able to answer it. There are several
other lists for other purposes:

 * [symfony-devs](http://groups.google.com/group/symfony-devs): For
   discussions on symfony core development (*not for support!*)

 * [symfony-docs](http://groups.google.com/group/symfony-docs): For
   discussions on symfony documentation

 * [symfony-community](http://groups.google.com/group/symfony-community): For
   discussions on community initiatives

With any of these mailinglists, you should keep in mind that they are less
direct in their nature than other means of communication such as IRC. It can
take hours or even up to a few days to get the response you are looking for.
It is important though to be responsive on any additional questions people
might have and not be too impatient.

Opposite to IRC, you should give as much background information with your
question. Information on configuration, which ORM you use, what kind of
operating system you are using, which possible solutions you tried and what
failed. Any code samples can be included in the e-mail, to give your problem
as much context as possible which may lead to the solution.

#### IRC

IRC is the most direct way to get answers because of its real-time nature.
Symfony has a dedicated channel called #symfony on the
[Freenode network](http://freenode.net/) where on any given time during the day many
people hang out. Be aware though that even though the channel may have over
100 users present, often many of these people are at work and don't constantly
check the IRC channel. So, though IRC is real-time in nature, it can sometimes
take a while to get a response.

The nature of IRC does not really allow for the displaying of big blocks of
code and such. So describe your problem in the IRC channel, but if you want to
show blocks of code or contents of configuration files, be sure to use sites
like pastebin.com and only reference the link in the IRC channel. People often
see the pasting of blocks of code as flooding the channel. This is not
appreciated and you might have a harder time getting an answer.

When asking a question in IRC, pay attention to the response you get. Be
responsive to any additional questions you may get about your problem. Be
aware that sometimes people in the IRC channel may even question your whole
approach to the problem. Sometimes they may be right, sometimes they may judge
your situation incorrectly, but make sure that you answer their questions and
describe your situation when people ask for it. They won't know your whole
project layout and so may make assumptions that prove incorrect once you
explain it more clearly. Don't feel offended by such things: The people in the
channel are only trying to help you.

When the channel is a bit busy, make sure you prefix any answers to specific
questions with the name of the person you are answering a question to. This
will make it more clear who you are talking to for those asking the question
but also for those in other conversations; they now know that they can ignore
your message because it is not a part of their conversation.

### Fixes and new Features

This is something we all seem to take for granted, but needs to be said: The
whole symfony codebase is one big community effort. There's a lot of time in
there from Sensio and Fabien specifically, but even their work is community
work because, by releasing it as Open-Source, they've shown their heart for the
community. But all the other developers that also work on either writing new
functionality of supplying bugfixes are doing this for the community. So when
you are working with symfony (or any other Open-Source project for that
matter) be aware that it is thanks to the community that you are able to use
the software.

### Plugins

Symfony has a very extensive plugin system, which allows you to easily install
external plugins into your symfony project. The plugin system is based on the
PEAR installer and channel system, and is very flexible. Aside from the
plugins that are included in the symfony distribution, there is a huge amount
of plugins that have been developed and are maintained by the community. You
can go to the [plugin site](http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/) and
browse through the plugins based on categories, ORM used, symfony version that
is supported and also search. Thanks to the work of the community you can find
plugins for a lot of the common functionality you find in today's web
applications.

### Conferences and Events

Aside from interacting with the community through digital means as described
before, you can also communicate with the community at conferences and other
events. Most of the PHP-related conferences and even some conferences aimed at
a wider audience than just PHP have some symfony community members attending
or even presenting. It is the work of these community members that will help
you learn from your peers at these conferences. There are events that are
completely built up around symfony. Some great examples of those are
[Symfony Live](http://www.symfony-live.com/), [Symfony Day](http://www.symfonyday.com/)
and [SymfonyCamp](http://www.symfonycamp.com/). All these events have the
backing of a company but most of the work is a community effort, and by
attending such an event you can learn a lot about symfony and get in touch
with those key community members that can help you a bit further when you're
stuck somewhere. If you have the opportunity of attending such an event, it is
definitely recommended to do so.

Aside from the above conferences, there is also a growing amount of symfony user
groups around the world. These user groups usually don't have any company
backing, but are just a gathering of symfony users on a regular basis in a
specific area. It is very easy to go to one of these gatherings, the only
effort it takes is to show up at one of the meetings. These meetings will
allow you to build up a network of symfony-related people who can help you
with symfony problems, might have a job for you if you're looking for
one, or know a developer that is available when you need one.

### Reputation

Being present in the community, being seen by people, talking to people,
perhaps also becoming more active in the community, will allow you to build a
reputation. At first, this may seem useless except that it is a nice ego
boost, but you can gain much more from that reputation. When you're looking
for a job, and notify the community of the fact, often you will get contacted
by one or two people to see if you fit their job opening. But once you've
started building a bit of a reputation, the amount of offers you get may grow
and the positions may also become more interesting.

Similarly, when you are looking for developers and notify the community about
it, you may get a few responses. As your reputation in the community grows,
the amount of responses may grow and you may even be able to pick from
some of the bigger names in the community for your job opening.

Giving back to the Community
----------------------------

Any community works only as a give-and-take system. If there was no one to
offer something to the community, there would be nothing to get from the
community either, and the community would not exist. So as you get something
from the community, it might also be good to think about what you can do back.
How can you help the community be a better community and grow? How can you
contribute to the existence and strength of the community? Let's go through
some ways you might be able to contribute.

### The Forums and Mailinglists

As described earlier, the forums and mailinglists are a place where you can
get support. You can get answers to your questions, suggestions on how to
solve problems, or feedback on a specific approach you've taken for your
project. And even though you might have just started out with symfony, as
you're getting some experience with symfony, you might be able to answer the
basic questions of other starting symfony users. And as you grow more
experienced with symfony, you'll be able to answer more advanced questions and
join in discussions of such issues. Even simply offering a direction a user
may want to look into can help people find the solution to their problem.
Since you might already be subscribed to a mailinglist, adding your expertise
is a small amount of effort that will help others.

### IRC

More direct communication around symfony is done on IRC, as described before.
Just as with the mailinglists, if you're hanging out in the IRC channel
anyway, you can scan it every once in a while for questions that you might
be able to answer. There is no need to keep a constant watch on the IRC channel,
most people in the #symfony channel don't keep a close watch all the time.
Instead, when they need a short break from their work, they switch
to their IRC client, check what discussions are going on, and try to give
their input in an effort to clarify any issues, help people or simply discuss
a specific feature. Being present in IRC, even though you don't directly check
the channel every minute, also allows people to "highlight" you by mentioning
your nickname. Most IRC clients will then notify you of the highlight, and you
can then respond. This will make you more approachable by the
community if they have a question that they know you might be able to answer. So
even when doing nothing, you are doing something useful: Being available.

### Contributing Code

Probably the easiest way for people who work with symfony to contribute is to
actually contribute some code. Since symfony users are all developers, this is
the most fun way to give something back to the community. There are several
ways of contributing code. Below if a list of ways to do that.

#### Core Patches

It can, of course, happen that while working with symfony you run into a bug.
Or, perhaps you want to do something, but find out symfony does not offer the
specific feature you would like to use. Working with a patched version of a
framework is not recommended since it might be a problem as soon as you update
the version. Also, you might forget about the patch and run into problems
later. And, especially when you run into a bug, it is good practice to notify
the framework developers of the issue. So, how can you actually do this?

First of all, the changes need to be made to the symfony code. The framework
files should be altered to fix the bug or add the behaviour. Then, assuming
the changes are done in a Subversion checkout of the symfony code, a diff can
be made of the changes done to the symfony codebase. With Subversion, this
could be done by issuing the following command:

    $ svn diff > my_feature_or_bug_fix.patch

This command should be issued in the root of the symfony checkout, to ensure
all changes that were made in the symfony code end up in the patch file.

The next step would be to go to
[the symfony bugtracker](http://trac.symfony-project.org). After logging in, a new option
appears to create a new ticket. When creating a new ticket, make sure to fill
in as many fields as possible, to make it easier for the core team to
reproduce bugs and/or know what parts of symfony are affected.

In the "Ticket Properties" box, make sure to select the right version of
symfony the patch was based on. Additionally, when possible, select the
component of symfony that is affected by the patch. When there are multiple
components affected, select the one that is most affected and make sure to
mention in the "Full Description" field which parts of symfony are affected.

Important to note is that the "Short Summary" field should contain the prefix
[PATCH] when a patch is attached. At the bottom of the form, make sure to
check the checkbox to indicate there is a patch file to attach to the new
ticket.

#### Contributing Plugins

Hacking into the framework core is not for everyone. But symfony users work on
symfony projects that contain custom functionality. Some functionality is very
specific to a project so won't be very useful to open up for others to use,
but often a project contains very generic code that could be of use to others.
It is a best practice to put a lot of the application logic in plugins to be
able to reuse them easily, at the very least, internally in the organization. But,
given the code was put into a plugin, it is also possible to Open-Source it
and make it available for all symfony users.

Contributing a plugin to the symfony community is quite easy. You can
[read the documentation](http://www.symfony-project.org/jobeet/1_3/Doctrine/en/20#chapter_20_contributing_a_plugin)
about how to create and package the plugin and upload it to the symfony
website. The symfony site allows plugin developers to use a full set of tools
to publish through the symfony plugin channel server and also to
host the plugin source in a Subversion repository on the symfony server so that other
developers can access the code. When considering opening up a plugin, this is
the recommended way of publishing the code. This is much easier than managing a
Subversion server and PEAR package server and creating the documentation to
explain to users how to use the custom systems. Adding a plugin to the
symfony plugin system will automatically make it available to all symfony
users without additional configuration. Obviously though, it is still possible
to create a PEAR package server and have users add that to their projects to
install plugins.

### Documentation

One of the very strong parts of symfony is its documentation. The core team
has written a lot of documentation on how to use symfony, but a big part of
the documentation is also there thanks to the community. There are also
joint efforts of the core team and the community, such as the work on the
Jobeet tutorial. Documentation helps new people learn symfony and also helps
as a reference for experienced developers, so it is very important to have
good documentation. There are several ways of contributing documentation for
symfony.

#### Write on your Weblog

Sharing experiences and knowledge on symfony is very important for the
community. Especially when running into something that is hard to figure out,
sharing it with the community is a good thing to do. Other people may have the
same problems and might be using a search engine to find out if other people
have had similar issues. Having some good search results will help solve their
issue much faster.

So when writing a blog post, the topic does not need to be a generic
introduction into symfony (of course it can be!), but can be about experiences
with the framework, solutions to problems that were encountered while working
with the framework, or a cool new feature of the latest version.

Anyone writing about symfony can add their weblog to the [symfony bloggers
list](http://trac.symfony-project.org/wiki/SymfonyBloggers). All weblogs on
this list are syndicated on the
[symfony community page](http://www.symfony-project.org/community). There are some guidelines
however: A symfony-specific feed is requested so that all content on the
community page is symfony related. Also, please don't add anything other than
weblogs (so no twitter feeds for instance).

#### Writing Articles

People that are more comfortable with their writing can take writing one step
further. There are several PHP magazines around the world as well as many computer
magazines that allow people to propose articles. Articles for such
publications are usually more advanced, more structured and of higher quality than
the average blogpost, but are also read by many more people.

Most publications have their own way of accepting article submissions, so
check with the magazine website or in the printed magazine to see what
steps to take to submit content to the magazine.

Aside from magazines, there are other places where articles are usually
welcomed. For instance, websites of PHP usergroups or symfony usergroups,
generic web development websites, and other online publications often
appreciate articles with good content that can be published on their website.

#### Translating Documentation

Most people doing PHP development these days will be familiar with the English
language. However, for many people it is not their native tongue making it
hard for them to read extensive technical content. Symfony promotes the
translation of documentation and supports it by offering write access to the
documentation repository for translators and publishing translated versions of
the documentation on the symfony website.

Translations of the documentation is mostly coordinated and discussed through
the [symfony docs mailinglist](http://groups.google.com/group/symfony-docs).
If you are interested in helping with translating the documentation to your
native language, this would be the first place to check. There is a chance
that there are multiple translators for a language, in which case it is very
important to coordinate efforts so as to not duplicate any work. The symfony
docs mailinglist is the perfect place to start your translations efforts.

#### Add Content to the Wiki

A wiki is one of the most open ways of documentation on any topic. Symfony has
a [wiki](http://trac.symfony-project.org/wiki) where people can add
documentation. It is always good to get more new content on the wiki. However,
it is also possible to contribute by looking at the existing articles on the
wiki and correcting and/or updating them. Aside from new articles, there are also
old articles that have outdated examples or may even be fully outdated.
Helping to clean up the existing content on the wiki is a great way to make it
easier for people searching through the wiki to find the right content.

If you want to get an idea of what kind of content is on the wiki or get some
inspiration for content you want to write, just have a look at the
[wiki homepage](http://trac.symfony-project.org/wiki) to see what is already
there.

### Presentations

Writing is a good way of sharing knowledge and experiences. The content is
available to a lot of people and is searchable. However, there are more ways
to get your experience and knowledge across. One good way that many people
appreciate is by doing presentations. You can do presentations in many
different settings and for many different audiences. For instance:

 * At PHP/symfony conferences
 * At local (PHP) user group meetings
 * Inside your company (for your developer colleagues)
 * Inside your company (for management)

Depending on the location and also your target audience, you will have to
adapt your presentation. While management will not be interested in all the
technical details, the audience at a symfony conference will not need
a basic introduction to symfony. Take your time to pick the right topic and
prepare a presentation. Have the slides reviewed by someone else and, if
possible, do a try-out of the presentation for some people who can and will
give honest feedback: not just praise, but also criticism so you can improve your
presentation before you do it for real.

Additional help on preparing and doing presentations is always available on
the [symfony community mailinglist](http://groups.google.com/group/symfony-community),
where experienced speakers as well as regular conference visitors will be able to help
with tips, tricks and experiences. Also, if you don't know of a conference or
user group where you could do your presentation, you can subscribe to the
mailinglist to get updates on Call for Papers of conferences or contacts with
usergroups.

### Organize an Event/Meetup

Aside from doing presentations on existing conferences and meetings, you can
also organize something yourself. It can be very small or very big. It can be
aimed at the worldwide community, or just your local users. It can even be
part of an existing event.

One example of this was the ad-hoc symfony update meeting that was held at the
PHPNW conference in 2008. This all started on the Twitter and IRC backchannel
for the conference, where several symfony users had some questions on what
symfony 1.2 would be like. Eventually a room was arranged thanks to the
organization and during one of the breaks between sessions, a group of
approximately 10 people gathered to get an update of what symfony 1.2 would
all be about. It was small and simple yet very effective as those present got
an idea of what to expect in the (at that time) new version of symfony.

Another great example is the organization of community conferences such as
[SymfonyCamp](http://www.symfonycamp.com/) and
[SymfonyDay Cologne](http://www.symfonyday.com/). Both symfony conferences were organized
by PHP development companies working with symfony and trying to give something
back to the community. All of these conferences were well-visited, had a great
speaker schedule and had a very nice community feel to them.

### Become locally active

It was mentioned before that not everyone is able to understand a lot of
technical content in english. Also, it can sometimes be nice to not only
communicate online about symfony. You can also become locally active. A
good example for this is local symfony user groups. Over the past year,
there have been several initiatives for the starting of new user groups,
and most have by now organized several get-togethers for people interested
in symfony or working with the framework. Most of these events are very
informal, free, and are completely community-driven.

The earlier mentioned
[symfony community mailinglist](http://groups.google.com/group/symfony-community) is a great
place to look for an existing usergroup in your area, as well as the place to
initiate a new symfony usergroup. There are members and organizers of local
symfony usergroups on the list that can offer their help with starting a new
local usergroup and getting organized.

Aside from the physical activities you can organize locally, you can also try
to promote symfony in your region on-line. One good example is by starting a
local symfony portal. A good example of such a local portal is the
[Spanish symfony portal](http://www.symfony.es/), which has regular updates on what is
happening with symfony posted to the website in Spanish. The site also
provides extensive Spanish documentation, so it is a great way for Spanish
developers to learn symfony and keep up-to-date with the new developments
around symfony.

### Becoming part of the Core Team

The core team is of course also a part of the community. The people that are
in the core team all started out as users of the framework and due to their
involvement in one way or another became a part of the core team. Symfony is a
[meritocracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy), which means that if
you prove your skills and/or talent, you might be able to become part of the
core team as well.

A good example of this is the
[joining of Bernhard Schussek](http://www.symfony-project.org/blog/2009/08/27/bernhard-schussek-joins-the-core-team).
Bernhard joined the core team after his fantastic work on the second version
of the Lime testing framework and having submitted patches consistently
for a long period of time.

### Where to start?

Now that you've heard what you can get from the community and how you can
contribute, it might be nice to have a short overview of the starting points
for getting involved in the symfony community. Use these to find your way
around the community.

#### Symfony-community Mailinglist

The [symfony-community mailinglist](http://groups.google.com/group/symfony-community)
is a mailinglist where members can discuss ideas for community efforts, join
community efforts currently being executed, and throw in anything community-related.
If you want to join one of these efforts, simply reply to the discussion
about the effort. If you have any new ideas that might be useful for the
symfony community, you can post them on this list. If you have questions
about the community or the different ways of communicating with the community,
this is also the place to be.

#### The "How to contribute to symfony" page

For quite some time now, symfony has had a special page on the wiki titled
[How to contribute to symfony](http://trac.symfony-project.org/wiki/HowToContributeToSymfony).
This page lists all the ways you can get involved in helping the symfony
project and community with whatever skills you have, and links to the right
places for most of these ways to help. It is a recommended read for anyone
who wants to get involved in the symfony community.

### External Communities

Please don't stop at becoming involved in the symfony community as described
in this article. There's a lot of initiatives worldwide that are started
around symfony and users of the framework. I want to give some extra attention
to two of these as they may be very useful for people working with symfony.

#### Symfonians

The [Symfonians community](http://www.symfonians.net/) is a community which
lists people and companies that work with symfony and projects done with
symfony. The site also allows companies to post job openings and allows you to
search within your own country for people, companies and projects.

Aside from the site being a great way to get in touch with other symfony
users or even find a job, the application directory is a great showcase of
what you can do with symfony. There is an enormous variety in the nature of
the applications listed on the site, making it very nice to browse through
to see what people do with the framework.

Since all content on the site is contributed by the community, you can also
get an account and create your own profile, your company profile, add
applications you've built with symfony or post job openings.

#### LinkedIn symfony Group

Any professional PHP developer has most probably encountered LinkedIn. Most
will have their own LinkedIn profile. For those who don't know LinkedIn: It
is a network site where you can maintain your own network and keep in touch
with the people in your network.

LinkedIn also offers a groups feature, allowing group discussions, news and
job postings. Many topics have a LinkedIn group, and
[symfony is no exception](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=29205&trk=myg_ugrp_ovr)
(login required). Using this symfony group, you can discuss symfony-related topics,
follow symfony-related news and also post jobs you have for symfony developers,
trainers, consultants and architects.

Final Thoughts
--------------

By now, you should have a good idea on what you can expect from the community,
and what the community may expect from you. Remember that any open source
software relies on a community being able to support the software. But
this support can be anything, from answering some questions to submitting
patches and plugins to promote the software. It would be great if you would
join us!
