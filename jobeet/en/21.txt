Day 21: The Design Day
======================

When we published the original Jobeet tutorial as an advent calendar for 2008,
we held a design contest on the 21st day. The goal was to choose the default
design used by Jobeet and people had to vote for the best submitted design.

The winner was **[centre{source}](http://www.centresource.com/)**, and its
design is the one you downloaded during day 4.

>**NOTE**
>centre{source} is a full-service interactive firm assisting organizations
>that view the web as a strategic asset. They provide their clients four
>essential services: strategy, planning, execution, and on-going management.
