Day 21: The Design Day
======================

As announced at the beginning of the Jobeet tutorial, we are holding a design

Have a look at the designs we have received and vote for the best one. Voting
is as simple as adding a comment on this post with the number of the design you
want to vote for, suffixed by `++`. So, if you want to vote for design number
"1", add a new comment with "1++" as the content (only votes with valid email
addresses will be taken into account).

The submitted designs are ordered by date of reception in my inbox.
