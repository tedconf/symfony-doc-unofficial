Day 18: AJAX
============

Previously on Jobeet
--------------------

Yesterday, we implemented a very powerful search engine for Jobeet, thanks to
the Zend Lucene library.

Today, to enhance the responsiveness of the search engine, we will take
advantage of [AJAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX) to convert the search
engine to a live one.

As the form should work with and without JavaScript enabled, the live search
feature will be implemented using
[unobtrusive JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript).
Using unobtrusive JavaScript also allows for a better separation of concerns in
the client code between HTML, CSS, and the JavaScript behaviors.

Installing JQuery
-----------------

Instead of reinventing the wheel and managing the many differences between browsers,
we will use a JavaScript library, [JQuery](http://jquery.com/). The symfony
framework itself is agnostic and can work with any JavaScript library.

Go to the [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) website, download the latest version,
and put the `.js` file under `web/js/`.

Including JQuery
----------------

As we will need JQuery on all pages, update the layout to include it in the
`<head>`. Be careful to insert the `use_javascript()` function before the
`include_javascripts()` call:

    [php]
    <!-- apps/frontend/templates/layout.php -->

      <?php use_javascript('jquery-1.2.6.min.js') ?>
      <?php include_javascripts() ?>
    </head>

We could have included the JQuery file directly with a `<script>` tag, but
using the `use_javascript()` helper ensures that the same JavaScript file
won't be included twice.

Adding Behaviors
----------------

Implementing a live search means that each time the user types a letter in the
search box, a call to the server need to be triggered; the server will then
return the needed information to update select regions of the page without
refreshing the whole page.

Instead of adding the behavior with an `on*()` HTML attributes, the main
principle behind JQuery is to add behaviors to the DOM after the page is
fully loaded. This way, if you disable JavaScript support in your browser,
no behavior is registered, and the form still works as before.

The first step is to intercept whenever a user types a key in the search box:

    [js]
    $('#search_keywords').keyup(function(key) {
      if (this.value.length >= 3 || this.value == '')
      {
        // do something
      }
    });

>**NOTE**
>Don't add the code for now, as we will modify it heavily. The final
>JavaScript code will be added to the layout in the next section.

Every time the user types a key, JQuery executes the anonymous function defined
in the above code, but only if the user has typed more than 3 characters or if
he removed everything from the input tag.

Making an AJAX call to the server is as simple as using the `load()` method on
the DOM element:

    [php]
    $('#search_keywords').keyup(function(key) {
      if (this.value.length >= 3 || this.value == '')
      {
        $('#jobs').load(
          '<?php echo url_for('@job_search') ?>', { query: this.value + '*' } }
        );
      }
    });

To manage the Ajax call, the same action as the "normal" one is called. The needed
changes in the action will be done in the next section.

But first, let's remove the search button if JavaScript is enabled:

    [php]
    $('.search input[type="submit"]').hide();

User Feedback
-------------

Whenever you make an AJAX call, the page won't be updated right away. The
browser will wait for the server response to come back before updating the page. In
the meantime, you need to provide visual feedback to the user to inform him
that something is going on.

A convention is to display a loader icon during the AJAX call. Update the
layout to add the loader image and hide it by default:

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/templates/layout.php
    <div class="search">
      <h2>Ask for a job</h2>
      <form action="<?php echo url_for('@job_search') ?>" method="get">
        <input type="text" name="query" value="<?php echo $sf_request->getParameter('query') ?>" id="search_keywords" />
        <input type="submit" value="search" />
        <img id="loader" src="/images/loader.gif" style="vertical-align: middle; display: none" />
        <div class="help">
          Enter some keywords (city, country, position, ...)
        </div>
      </form>
    </div>

You can download the loader image in
[today's repository](http://svn.jobeet.org/tags/release_day_18/web/images/loader.gif).

>**NOTE**
>The loader is optimized for the current layout of Jobeet. If you want to
>create your own, you will find a lot of free online services like
>http://www.ajaxload.info/.

Now that you have all the pieces needed to make the HTML work, open the layout
file and add the following JavaScript code at the end of the `<head>` section:

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/templates/layout.php
    <script type="text/javascript">
      $(document).ready(function() {
        $('.search input[type="submit"]').hide();

        $('#search_keywords').keyup(function(key) {
          if (this.value.length >= 3 || this.value == '')
          {
            $('#loader').show();
            $('#jobs').load(
              '<?php echo url_for('@job_search') ?>',
              { query: this.value + '*' },
              function() { $('#loader').hide(); }
            );
          }
        });
      });
    </script>

AJAX in an Action
-----------------

If JavaScript is enabled, JQuery will intercept all keys typed in the search
box, and will call the `search` action. If not, the same `search` action is
also called when the user submits the form by pressing the "enter" key or by
clicking on the "search" button.

So, the `search` action now needs to determine if the call is made via AJAX or not.
Whenever a request is made with an AJAX call, the `isXmlHttpRequest()` method
of the request object returns `true`.

>**NOTE**
>The `isXmlHttpRequest()` method works with all major JavaScript libraries
>like Prototype, Mootools, or jQuery.

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/modules/job/actions/actions.class.php
    public function executeSearch(sfWebRequest $request)
    {
      if (!$query = $request->getParameter('query'))
      {
        return $this->forward('job', 'index');
      }

<propel>
      $this->jobs = JobeetJobPeer::getForLuceneQuery($query);
</propel>
<doctrine>
      $this->jobs = Doctrine::getTable('JobeetJob')->getForLuceneQuery($query);
</doctrine>

      if ($request->isXmlHttpRequest())
      {
        return $this->renderPartial('job/list', array('jobs' => $this->jobs));
      }
    }

As JQuery won't reload the page but will only replace the `#jobs` DOM element
with the response content, the page should not be decorated by the layout. As
this is a common need, the layout is disabled by default when an AJAX request
comes in.

Moreover, instead of returning the full template, we only need to return the
content of the `job/list` partial. The `renderPartial()` method used in the
action returns the partial as the response instead of the full template.

If the user removes all characters in the search box, or if the search returns
no result, we need to display a message instead of a blank page. We will use
the `renderText()` method to render a simple test string:

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/modules/job/actions/actions.class.php
    public function executeSearch(sfWebRequest $request)
    {
      if (!$query = $request->getParameter('query'))
      {
        return $this->forward('job', 'index');
      }

<propel>
      $this->jobs = JobeetJobPeer::getForLuceneQuery($query);
</propel>
<doctrine>
      $this->jobs = Doctrine::getTable('JobeetJob')->getForLuceneQuery($query);
</doctrine>

      if ($request->isXmlHttpRequest())
      {
        if ('*' == $query || !$this->jobs)
        {
          return $this->renderText('No results.');
        }
        else
        {
          return $this->renderPartial('job/list', array('jobs' => $this->jobs));
        }
      }
    }

>**TIP**
>You can also return a component by using the `renderComponent()` method.

JavaScript as an Action
-----------------------

Although putting the JavaScript directly into the `<head>` tag makes perfect
sense for the Jobeet search engine, it is sometimes better to create a
dedicated file. But as the most JavaScripts that make AJAX calls need some
URLs, they need to use the `url_for()` helper, and therefore should be
dynamic.

JavaScript is just another format like HTML, and as seen some days ago,
symfony makes format management quite easy. As the JavaScript file will
contain behavior for a page, you can even have the same URL as the page for
the JavaScript file, but ending with `.js`. For instance, if you want to
create a file for the search engine behavior, you can modify the `job_search`
route as follows:

    [yml]
    job_search:
      url:   /search.:sf_format
      param: { module: job, action: search, sf_format: html }
      requirements:
        sf_format: (?:html|js)

>**NOTE**
>As the URLs on a website are stable, the JavaScript files are mostly static,
>and don't change over time. This is a perfect candidate for caching, as we
>will see in a coming day.

Testing AJAX
------------

As the symfony browser cannot simulate JavaScript, you need to help it when
testing AJAX calls. It mainly means that you need to manually add the header
that JQuery and all other major JavaScript libraries send with the request:

    [php]
    // test/functional/frontend/jobActionsTest.php
    $browser->setHttpHeader('X_REQUESTED_WITH', 'XMLHttpRequest');
    $browser->
      info('5 - Live search')->

      get('/search?query=sens*')->
      with('response')->begin()->
        checkElement('table tr', 3)->
      end()
    ;

The `setHttpHeader()` method set an HTTP header for the very next request made
with the browser.

See you Tomorrow
----------------

Yesterday, we used the Zend Lucene library to implement the search engine.
Today, we have used JQuery to make it more responsive. The symfony framework
provides all the fundamental tools to build MVC applications with ease, and
also plays well with other components. As always, try to use the best tool for
the job.

Tomorrow, we will see how to internationalize the Jobeet website.
