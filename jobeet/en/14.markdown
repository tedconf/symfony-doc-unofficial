Day 14: The Lazy Day
====================

With the description of the symfony User class yesterday, we have now finished
our tour of the fundamental features of symfony. You still need to learn a lot
but you should already be able to create simple symfony projects all by
yourself.

To celebrate this great milestone, we will have a break today. Or, more
precisely, I will have a break today. I will give you some hints on what you
can do today to improve your symfony skills.

Learning by Practicing
----------------------

The symfony framework, as does any piece of software, has a learning curve. In
the learning process, the first step is to learn from practical examples with
tutorials or a book like this one. The second step is to **practice**.
Nothing will ever replace practicing.

That's what you can start doing today. Think about the simplest web project
that still provides some value: a todo list manager, a simple blog, a time or
currency converter, whatever... Choose one and start implementing it with the
knowledge you have today. Use the task help messages to learn the different
options, browse the code generated by symfony, use a text editor that has PHP
auto-completion support like [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/), read the
[online API](http://www.symfony-project.org/api/1_3/) when you need to find
new methods, start asking questions on the
[user mailing-list](http://groups.google.com/group/symfony-users/), chat on
the [#symfony IRC channel on freenode](irc://irc.freenode.net/symfony).

Enjoy all the free material you have at your disposal to learn more about
symfony.
