Sending ~Emails~
================

Whenever an affiliate account is activated by the administrator, an email
should be sent to the affiliate to confirm his subscription and give him his
token.

The symfony framework comes bundled with one of the best PHP emailing
solution: [Swift Mailer](http://www.swiftmailer.org/). Of course, the library
is fully integrated with symfony, with some cool features added on top of its
core features.

Sending Emails
--------------

Edit the `activate` action to send an email when the administrator validates
an affiliate:

    [php]
    // apps/backend/modules/affiliate/actions/actions.class.php
    class affiliateActions extends autoAffiliateActions
    {
      public function executeListActivate()
      {
        $affiliate = $this->getRoute()->getObject();
        $affiliate->activate();

        // send an email to the affiliate
        ProjectConfiguration::registerZend();
        $mail = new Zend_Mail();
        $mail->setBodyText(<<<EOF
    Your Jobeet affiliate account has been activated.

    Your token is {$affiliate->getToken()}.

    The Jobeet Bot.
    EOF
    );
        $mail->setFrom('jobeet@example.com', 'Jobeet Bot');
        $mail->addTo($affiliate->getEmail());
        $mail->setSubject('Jobeet affiliate token');
        $mail->send();

<propel>
        $this->redirect('@jobeet_affiliate');
</propel>
<doctrine>
        $this->redirect('@jobeet_affiliate_affiliate');
</doctrine>
      }

      // ...
    }

For the code to work, you need to change `jobeet@example.com` to a real email
address.
