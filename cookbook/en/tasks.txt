How to create a task
====================

As any web application, your project has repetitive maintenance tasks, database operations, or other console scripts to manipulate your data model.

Symfony 1.1 extends symfony 1.0 tasks to create a powerful and uniform command line utility for your projects, fully integrated with the symfony CLI.

The major advantages we get are:

 * **Environment**: The context is under control, thanks to the new `ProjectConfiguration` and `ApplicationConfiguration` classes.

 * **Integration**: Running the symfony CLI will give you the tasks list, and even a non developer will be able to learn easily how to run one. And knowing how to run one is like knowing how to run them all.

 * **Accessibility**: Any task can be run with the `help` parameter passed, to get help on the syntax, a description, available options, and more. Anybody will be able to run your tasks.

 * **Uniformity**: By describing explicitly every options and parameters, symfony CLI will parse them and display errors if user uses an invalid syntax or value. Moreover, any task works the same way. You won't worry anymore about batch naming or harcoded environment configuration within it.

 * **Readability**: Anyone opening a task file will get great description of what it expects, and what is useable. Maintenance time saved will grow with your project.

Let's write our first task
--------------------------

First create a `%SF_ROOT_DIR%/lib/task/doNothingTask.class.php` file, and open it in your favorite editor.

    [php]
    class doNothingTask extends sfBaseTask
    {
      protected function configure()
      {
        $this->namespace        = 'project';
        $this->name             = 'do-nothing';
        $this->briefDescription = 'Does strictly nothing';
   
        $this->detailedDescription = <<<EOF
    This task is completely useless, and should be run as often as possible.
    EOF;
      }
   
      protected function execute($arguments = array(), $options = array())
      {
        $this->logSection('do-nothing', 'I did nothing successfully!');
      }
    }

This task for sure does not much, but demonstrates the first basic concepts.:

  * The `configure()` method describes the task. Invocation name, scope, syntax, help, options and arguments.
  * The `execute()` method is the one who does all the job actually, and will be called when the task is run.
  * The `logSection()` method can be used to print messages on the console output.

You can play around a bit with it:

    $ php symfony help project:do-nothing
    $ php symfony project:do-nothing

Some command line interaction
-----------------------------

Arguments and options are the way to give parameters to a task.

    $ php symfony project:hello-world --name="Romain"

Here we're running the `project:hello-world` task with the `name` option set to `Romain`

    $ php symfony project:hello-world Hi

Now, we run the same task with the first argument set to `Hi`.

Options and arguments can have default values, be optional or required and embed their purpose to be displayed in task syntax.

Let's write our `project:hello-world` task:

    [php]
    class doHelloWorldTask extends sfBaseTask
    {
      protected function configure()
      {
        $this->addArgument('verb', sfCommandArgument::OPTIONAL, 'Customize the verb used to say hello', 'hello');
        $this->addOption('name', null, sfCommandOption::PARAMETER_OPTIONAL, 'Customize the person to say hello to', 'world');
    
        $this->namespace        = 'project';
        $this->name             = 'hello-world';
        $this->briefDescription = 'Spread the (hello) world';
    
        $this->detailedDescription = <<<EOF
    Runs an evolved hello world display, with customisable name and word.
    EOF;
      }
    
      protected function execute($arguments = array(), $options = array())
      {
        $this->logSection('do', ucfirst($arguments['verb']).' '.ucfirst($options['name']));
      }
    }

Now check out how symfony helps the lost user about how to use our new task:

    $ php symfony project:hello-world invalid arguments given
    $ php symfony help project:hello-world

And play a bit with the task:

    $ php symfony project:hello-world
    $ php symfony project:hello-world --name="romain"
    $ php symfony project:hello-world --name=romain hi
    $ php symfony project:hello-world hi --name=romain

Some other handy features
-------------------------

  * **Do you need the database layer?**

       [php]
       protected function execute($arguments = array(), $options = array())
       {
         $databaseManager = new sfDatabaseManager($this->configuration);

         // ...
       }

  * **Run another task within a task?**

       [php]
       $myOtherTask = new myOtherTask($this->dispatcher, $this->formatter);
       $myOtherTask->run($arguments = array('foo' => 'bar'), $options = array('far' => 'boo'));

  * **Need to let the user choose the environment, while providing a default one?**

   Just add the `env` option in the `::configure()` method and symfony will use its value as the environemnt.

       [php]
       $this->addOption('env', null, sfCommandOption::PARAMETER_OPTIONAL, 'Changes the environment this task is run in', 'prod');

What do you think? Won't this new powerful batch subsystem greatly improve your project maintenance times?
