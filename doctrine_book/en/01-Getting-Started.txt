Chapter 1 - Getting Started
===========================

>**NOTE**
>The symfony and Doctrine book does not explain in detail everything about Doctrine. It briefly touches on a few critical subjects that symfony utilizes the most. The Doctrine manual is still the best source of documentation for referencing everything that is Doctrine. It is recommended you read this book to get started and then utilize the Doctrine manual for referencing the specifics of using Doctrine. You can find the main Doctrine documentation [here](http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation "Doctrine Documentation").

## What is Doctrine?

Doctrine is a PHP ORM (object relational mapper) for PHP 5.2.3+ that sits on top of a powerful PHP DBAL (database abstraction layer). One of its key features is the ability to optionally write database queries in an OO (object oriented) SQL-dialect called DQL inspired by Hibernates HQL. This provides developers with a powerful alternative to SQL that maintains a maximum of flexibility without requiring needless code duplication.

## Enable Doctrine

In order to begin using Doctrine you must first enable it by editing your `config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php` setup() method to enable sfDoctrinePlugin and disable sfPropelPlugin.

    [php]
    public function setup()
    {
      $this->enablePlugin('sfDoctrinePlugin');
      $this->disablePlugin('sfPropelPlugin');
    }

## Available Tasks

Below is the complete list of tasks available with the sfDoctrinePlugin. It offers all the same functionality as propel plus much more.

    $ ./symfony list doctrine
    Usage:
      symfony [options] task_name [arguments]

    Options:
      --dry-run     -n  Do a dry run without executing actions.
      --help        -H  Display this help message.
      --quiet       -q  Do not log messages to standard output.
      --trace       -t  Turn on invoke/execute tracing, enable full backtrace.
      --version     -V  Display the program version.
